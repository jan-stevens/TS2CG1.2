# TS2CG version 1.2

NOTE: this version is under development and might be associated with errors and bugs.
Please use the previous version if you are not in direct contact with the developers.

TS2CG converts triangulated surfaces (TS) to coarse-grained membrane models for molecular simulation.
It also works as a backmapping algorithm from dynamically triangulated surfaces simulations to CG molecular dynamics simulations or 
to take electron microscopy tomography data and build structures for molecular dynamics simulations.

TS2CG is implemented in C++ and includes two separate scripts. Pointillism (PLM) and CG Membrane Builder (PCG).
